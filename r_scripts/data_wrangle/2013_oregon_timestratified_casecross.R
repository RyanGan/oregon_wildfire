# Title: Oregon Case-crossover dataframe creation (only patients with single obs)
#        and joining with and zip-level PM2.5 values. 
# Author: Jingyang Liu
# Date Created: Nov 27 2017     
# R version: 3.3.3
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Notes ----
# Notes 8/16/16: I updated smoke data with population weighted averages for zip
# This code also assumed only one visit, so I remove the people with multiple
# admissions for the outcome

# Notes 10/3/16: I'm retaining the county assignment of the observation so I
# can join the county population weighted averages as well for comparison
# and to analyze morbidity similar to Rish

# Libraries ----
# load libraries
#library(tidyverse) # tidyverse not on the server
# if tidyverse is not available, use dplyr and readr
library(dplyr) 
library(readr)
library(lubridate) # working with date
# parallel computing libraries
# library(foreach) 
# library(doParallel)

# Read in smoke data created in loop -------------------------------------------

# read in zipcode level populatoin-weighted pm
